"Description":"Project Logi-col[i]: Terminator/Attenuator anti-sense Logic (T/AasL)",
"Abstract":"Two major hurdles facing the development of complex genetic logic circuits are device connectibility and device extensibility.  Connectibility refers to the ability to connect the output of one device to the input of another device, while extensibility refers to the dual abilities to rationally design new devices and combine multiple devices in one organism.  Our project uses terminator/attenuator (T/A) hairpin sequences (gates) to control transcription and anti-sense RNA as input/output signals to/from the devices.  We call this approach Terminator/Attenuator anti-sense Logic (T/AasL – pronounced “taw-ssel”).  It solves the connectibility problems of common protein-based approaches because the anti-sense output of one device is used to disrupt formation of T/A hairpin structures of downstream devices, thus activating them.  In addition, because RNA secondary structures can be rationally designed (using our m-fold derived analysis program) we can readily construct a large family of devices with minimal cross-talk for inclusion in a single cell"

"Abstract":"Every year over 1.2 million people suffer myocardial infarction.  The resulting heart damage requires new approaches for effective repair.  Stem cell therapies provide hope.  However none of the stem cell therapies currently in clinical trials addresses the need  for efficient stem cell targeting to cardiac tissue or the need to replace efficiently dead tissue with new cardiomyocytes.  To address these problems, we have built several genetic circuits that work sequentially to repair the heart.  First, we have built an inducible differentiation circuit that closely resembles the endogenous differentiation pathway, to program cells to become cardiomyocytes.  Second, we have built circuits that use the extracellular domains of chimeric proteins to target cells to damaged cardiac tissue. Upon binding, novel receptor-coupled intein-mediated signaling domains activate effector genes that then aid in integration, inhibition of cell death, and the alteration of the tissue microenvironment"

All construction projects require the manipulation of varying size components, many much larger than any individual. To make this  possible, teams of individuals work together towards a common goal. To find out how to transfer this behaviour to our ``Bacto-Builders<i>, we investigate the possibility of using large numbers of E. coli to  perform a task too great for any individual cell. Specifically, this involves the physical movement of particles through direct contact with a swarm of bacteria working together in a co-ordinated manner.  The ultimate goal is to engineer the bacteria to follow a set of simple rules, so that collective behaviour emerges, and particles are assembled  into a desired pattern. Furthermore, patterns or structures  could be evolved in real time with bacteria adapting to new dynamic requirements or autonomously forming new structures.</i"

Our task is to design an effective as well as intelligent PCBs degrader. According to the recent research, ortho-chlorinated PCB metabolites (DHBs) are potent and physiologically significant inhibitors of DHBD, so we design a feedback activation pathway to increase the BphC transcription and expression under a 2, 3-DHBP and 4-CB inducible promoter Ppcb. As dihydrodiols and dihydroxybiphenyls are very toxic to bacterial even after short incubation time, we design a feedback repression pathway use sRNA components— sodB and rhyB. As to the sensor part, dihydroxylated PCBs are substrate of the clcA-encoded chlorocatechol dioxygenase and thus induce the clcR and related promoter, so we use this as the sensing system. T7 amplification system is added to the downstream to amplify the signal.  "

Core elements of the genetic memory are two mutually regulated promoters, designed as independent operator sites flanking a constitutive promoter. Thus, promoter transcriptional strength and repressor binding affinity can be independently fixed.

We have designed a modular genetic circuit to limit the expression level of a gene of interest to a user-defined, tunable threshold.  The limiter network reacts to the transcription of an endogenous gene within each cell, entering a regulatory state only where and when the rate of transcription lies beyond an acceptable range of activity.

In addition, our third population of E. coli (termed Champion cell) acts as a biosensor by receiving these signal inputs and subsequently initiating transcription of specific E. coli-targeted bacteriocins (i.e. colicins) in tandem with specific fluorescent proteins. The presence of AI-1 induces the Champion to produce a colicin to which Bad guy #1 is susceptible, but to which Bad guy #2 is resistant, and vice-versa for AI-2."

Although different quorum sensing species have slightly different signaling molecules, these molecules are not completely specific to their hosts and cross-species reactivity is observed.

Firstly, biologically produced plastics such as polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are superior to petroleum-based plastics because they are both biodegradable and biocompatible. By focusing on modulating the ratio of two PHA monomers, 3-hydroxybutyrate and 4-hydroxybutyrate, the copolymer poly(3HB-co-4HB) can be created featuring increased elasticity and utility over any particular PHA monomer. Secondly, a novel polyethylene-degradation pathway is being engineered based on the oxidation of long-chain alkanes by alkane monooxygenase LadA. The region inhibiting the binding and catalysis of polyethylene has been computationally identified and site-directed mutagenesis is being conducted at this region to yield a mutant of LadA that oxidizes polyethylene and thereby increases its biodegradability. The combination of the production of an eco-friendly bioplastic with the degradation of petroleum-based plastics is a promising method of waste reduction"

Furthermore, developmental studies have highlighted the importance of gradient formation  and cell-cell communication for the generation of cellular patterns in the early stages of life. It has been shown that simple networks can form both static and dynamic patterns. Nonetheless, a system whose pattern formation is dependent on combinations of multiple signals has yet to be demonstrated. Here we address this question by designing a network, involving two different quorum-sensing based signaling mechanisms. Upon introduction in E.coli, the system can sense the relative amounts of two input molecules. Using a pre-define set of rules which was selected on its ability to generate spatial patterns, the cell can then express its final state by emitting red or green fluorescence and transmit its state to its neighbors."

Additionally, one of the main complications when implementing genetic circuits is possible cross-talk with endogenous pathways. Thus, an organism carrying a minimal genome would provide a simple chassis for biological engineering. Our approach is based on an iterative cycle of genome reduction and strain selection. We propose a novel method to randomly delete chromosomal fragments by controlled expression of restriction enzymes and ligases in vivo. Furthermore we develop a chemostat-based selective condition for cells having a smaller genome by constraining nucleotide availability.

The final objective is to express the extent of RcnA's repression (and so the extracellular nickel concentration) as a function of AHL present in the cell"

"Description":"Ligase-Independent Cloning as a Standard for BioBrick Preparation",
"Abstract":"While there is an established BioBrick format, there is not yet a standard method for turning a gene of interest into a BioBrick.  Ideally, such a standard method would be easily adopted, even by amateurs, and would lend itself to automation.  A significant drawback of several existing techniques is their dependence on ligase treatment, which is often problematic.  We propose a ligase-independent cloning (LIC) method, based on the technique of Aslanidis &amp; de Jong (1990), as a possible standard for novel BioBrick preparation.  Instead of short overhangs and ligase treatment, LIC uses long overhangs to circularize plasmid vectors for transformation without the use of ligase.  The LIC method reduces the number of enzyme steps required for cloning, thus lending itself to easy adoption, automation, and real biological 'engineering."

As a result, a huge proportion of the earth's biomass resources are trapped in a highly degradation resistant lignin matrix.  To make these resources viable for energy and chemical needs, lignin must be broken down to separate the chemical components of biomass. We have isolated a single gene from the Lignin Peroxidase gene family.  It produces the enzyme responsible for initiating the breakdown of lignin.

The desired result is quantitative control of transcript levels, which is often necessary to balance flux through a synthetic metabolic pathway. To demonstrate its potential for real-world application, the team is planning to employ this approach to control the expression of a heterologous pathway in E. coli for the biosynthesis of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), a biodegradable polyester plastic"

"Abstract":"We have developed a system allowing to search for antibodies with new specificities or screen protein libraries in order to generate interactors for a given bait. Our system changes a protein sequence to maximize its interaction with a given partner. Proteins with modified sequences are then directed to the bacterial outer membrane, where the best interactors are selected. Protein presented on the cell surface is fused with part of β-lactamase protein, while its bait is fused with the complementing part of the enzyme and added to medium. The stronger the interaction between proteins of interest, the more efficient the binding of the two halves of  β-lactamase, leading to resistance to ampicillin and survival. Cells expressing less interacting variants die as they don't achieve sufficient complementation of the reporter enzyme. This allows us to select strains producing interactors for any given bait"

Team Wisconsin used Escherichia coli to produce biofuel precursors in an effort to find these alternative fuel sources. One project focused on using E. coli to efficiently produce sorbitol, a biofuel precursor. Using computer modeling, we determined a way to funnel glycolysis’ intermediates towards the production of sorbitol via sorbitol-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Wisconsin’s second aim was to isolate high-energy precursors from the plant cell wall through E. coli mediated breakdown of cell wall lignin. This was achieved by inserting the gene encoding lignin peroxidase , found in the white rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium, into genetically modified E. coli, capable of producing and exporting the enzyme. Both projects improve current methods in the production of alternative fuels via two different, unique routes, and have the potential to move sustainable biofuel research forward"

Pipe breach detection and the restoration of pipe integrity were implemented through exploitation of chemotaxis, and cell lysis that releases a two-component protein-based glue (lysyl oxidase and tropoelastin). Control was achieved using an AND gate with quorum sensing and the lac inducer IPTG (released from the breach) as inputs. Deterministic and stochastic models of the genetic circuit, integrated with an agent-based model of E.coli cells, were used to define the effective radii of cell migration and timing of lysis. Constructed AND gate, quorum sensing and lysis timing modules were experimentally tested. The two-component glue concept was successfully validated using in vitro alpha-omega complementation of beta-galatosidase activity.

OMVs carry outer membrane, periplasmic and cytoplasmic proteins, DNA, RNA and other biological molecules. They protect their cargo from the extracellular environment and deliver it to a multitude of target cells via membrane fusion. We investigate the possibility of allowing the secretion of any protein in OMVs via fusion with novel, non-toxic partners enhanced in OMVs, using a novel Bioscaffold compatible with the current assembly standard.

Combining a transcription-translation system with protein coding genes and a recombination logic inside microdroplets provides spatial control. Moreover, in the microfluidic chamber we can pinpoint the beginning of synthesis, and easily track and isolate the droplets. Site-specific recombination generates a molecular timer for temporal control of protein synthesis. Unlike transcriptional regulation, this method gives true all-or-none induction due to covalent modification of DNA by Flp recombinase.

This target includes a region complementary to the TRANS-repressor sequence antisense, ends with RBS, and is assembled upstream of the coding sequence to be silenced. Upon binding of TRANS-repressor and CIS-repressing RNAs, the access to RBS by ribosomes is hampered, silencing translation. Accordingly, the amount of TRANS-repressor controls the translation rate of the regulated gene. The TRANS-repressor sequence was determined by a computational analysis performed to minimize the interference with the genomic mRNAs and to maximize the base-pairing interaction to the CIS-repressing RNA.

A similar system can be used to “lock” the function of a gene of interest, like a combination lock, which is unlocked only when the cultures are grown in a pre-determined order of selection pressures. In principle, using this locking system, multiple plasmids can be maintained using a single selection pressure."

"Abstract":"The Illinois iGEM team has been working to engineer a decoder function within E. coli.  Decoders are logic devices used frequently in low-level computer architecture. We are creating a 2 to 4 decoder, which takes two binary inputs to activate one of four outputs.  Each output corresponds to a specific combination of the inputs.  With the presence of lactose and arabinose, our Bacterial Decoder will express Green Fluorescent Protein.  If only lactose is present, a different fluorescent protein will be expressed.  This goes for the other two combinations as well (only arabinose, or neither sugars).  To implement logic we use combinations of small non-coding RNAs and transcription factors.  The system allows the next engineer to swap standard parts in and out to change the inputs and outputs.  Our Bacterial Decoder can help sense for multiple environmental cues, having implications for medical diagnostics and environmental and water contaminant detection"

Our goal is to show that spatio-temporal structures can be generated by the behavior of a genetic regulatory network. We implement the model by means of several biobricks. We construct a self activating module and correspondingly an inhibitory one.  Self-activation dynamics is given by the las operon, while the inhibitory part is provided by the lux operon. Quorum sensing and diffusion of AHL provide the reaction-diffusion mechanism responsible for the formation of Turing patterns. The importance of our work relies on the fact that we show that the  action of the morphogenes as originally proposed by Turing is equivalent to the effect of  diffusion of chemicals interacting with the synthetic network, which accounts for the reactive part, a possibility implicit in Turing’s original work in the context of  morphogenesis of biological patterns"

The other one, “Cells in Cells” is the project to make a cell.  We defined making cells as making liposomes that can divide like mitochondria do.  To approach our goal, we set two subgoals.

From the fact that this mechanism is sensitive to a certain wavelength of light, we hope to create a system that can be sensitive to various wavelengths and hence triggering different protein generation.

Whatsoever its nature, the vector encounters many problems&nbsp;: Stability, targeting, membrane passage, and the immune response. Therefore, we tried to achieve the ideal vector, being the most stable as possible, can easily penetrate its targets, and outwit the immune system. We have created a double vectorization system, by using jointly a bacteria and a phage. The first vector which is bacterial, will target the tissue, and resist to the immune system. The second vector is a phage, will be used for cell targeting and  membrane penetration.  The combination of the two systems improves the intrinsic abilities of vectors, and offers new possibilities for applications"

This set of rules is called a grammar. A grammar tells us how to order words in a meaningful way.

We propose in our project a biological model which is based on this con- cept of language parsing from computational linguistics"

Today, the Martian environment is severe for any life to inhabit because of some constrained conditions. For instances, the surface temperature having a range from -80℃ to 15℃, CO2 occupying 95% of the atmosphere and the absence of organic substances on the surface don't allow aerobic organisms or heterotrophic bacteria to grow. Our project objective is to create a genetically engineered iron-oxidizing bacteria surviving on Mars and to establish a new model organism playing an important role to terraform Mars. We engineered Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans by introducing a synthetic pathway of both Melanin and Anti Freeze Protein with temperature-regulated systems. Anti Freeze Protein contributes to enhance tolerance of cryogenic condition and Melanin to blacken the Martian surface eventually resulting in melt of ice cap and generation of atmosphere and sea."

We created a green light-activated actuator to respond to external light signals, as well as a riboregulator-based signal counter to count the number of flashes. In ESCAPES, the first green light flash induces the E. coli to self-aggregate, while the second flash causes them to auto-lyse, thus greatly simplifying the protein preparation process. The light-activated actuator was constructed by fusing the light responsive domain of the Synechocystis photoreceptor CcaS with the EnvZ histidine kinase domain. Self-aggregation is achieved by the induction of the Antigen43 gene, which we isolated from E. coli, while autolysis took advantage of the available BioBrick parts endolysin and holin. ESCAPES helps you “escape” from tedious protein preparation steps, such as centrifugation and cell disruption."

Coding sequences  of pyruvate-decarboxylase (pdc) and alcohol-dehydrogenaseII (adhB), essential in alcoholic fermentation pathway, were designed by DNA chemical synthesis and codon-optimized for E. coli. The final circuit includes the device to metabolize lactose and the ethanol-producing operon, containing pdc and adhB. It has a theoretical yield of 20kilos/tons of whey.

"Abstract":"Photosynthetic light harvesting antennas function to collect light and transfer energy to a reaction center for photochemistry. Phototrophs evolved large antennas to compete for photons in natural environments where light is scarce.  Consequently, cells at the surface of photobioreactors over-absorb light, leading to attenuated photobioreactor light penetration and starving cells on the interior of photons. This reduction of photosynthetic productivity has been identified as the primary impediment to improving photobioreactor efficiency.  While reduction of antenna size improves photosynthetic productivity, current approaches to this end uniformly truncate antennas and are difficult to manipulate from the perspective of bioengineering. We aim to create a modifiable system to optimize antenna size throughout the bioreactor by utilizing a synthetic regulatory mechanism that correlates expression of the pucB/A LH2 antenna genes with incident light intensity. This new application of synthetic biology serves to transform the science of antenna reduction into the engineering of antenna optimization. "

Two enzymes, glycine/sarcosine methyltransferase, and sarcosine/dimethyglycine methyltransferase, catalyze three successive methylations of glycine for de novo synthesis of glycine betaine.  Here, we demonstrate an engineered E. coli with an increased growth rate under salt induced stress.  We highlight utility by demonstrating the improved growth of fuel producing bacteria in ocean water"

"Description":" The AyeSwitch: a translationally regulated genetic toggle switch in yeast",
"Abstract":"A novel genetic toggle switch regulated at the translational level was engineered in yeast that allowed the mutually exclusive expression of either green or cyan fluorescent protein. Using cell cytometry (FACS) and fluorimetry, we demonstrated in yeast the successful expression and translational regulation of a fusion of mRNA binding protein and fluorescent protein. These results, along with published parameter values, were used to predict via deterministic and stochastic models that the probability of successful bistability for our switch was 0.96%, but this could be improved theoretically to a maximum of 51.27% by limiting the range of variation of the most sensitive parameters.  The models also predicted that co-operative binding of the mRNA binding protein to its mRNA stem loop was essential for generating switch-like behaviour.  These results suggest that a translationally regulated genetic toggle switch is a viable and novel engineering concept applicable to medicinal, environmental and technological problems"

These easy to culture and robust organisms are also a desirable eukaryotic chassis for synthetic biology, but there are few tools for delivering biomolecules into these organisms. So, we engineered E. coli to deliver proteins and/or DNA payloads into these bacteria-devouring eukaryotes. Once ingested, our E. coli are programmed to self-lyse and porate the phagosome, releasing their payloads into the cytosol. This delivery mechanism has the potential to deliver payload to any phagocytic organism with a cholesterol-based membrane. As part of our parallel software effort to rework the Clotho plugin environment and API, we made automatic biosafety handling an intrinsic feature of the core.

On an industrial scale, this chemical induction requires large quantities of reagents and extensive purification, while environmental induction requires conditions that can adversely affect cell vitality and yield. To this end, we have designed an E. coli genetic circuit that can pass through four stable states of protein production triggered solely by ON/OFF patterns of light. To efficiently test the components of our circuit, we have also created a system for the transient delivery of transcription factors through the cell and nuclear membranes.

We have designed a system that can accurately and visually report whether a gene is being transcribed and/or translated. The system also differentiates whether expression is failing due to misfolding in the periplasm or cytoplasm.  In the case of misfolding, our system can also fine tune expression levels of a given protein to optimize production, increasing the likelihood of obtaining functional protein.  To further understand protein misfolding we have built an equation-based, multivariant model of inclusion body formation.

To discriminate double-click from two separated single-clicks, the 1st input is to be memorized temporarily. If the 2nd input is added before the memory gets lost, output will be produced. If the 2nd input is not added within the given time, the system will be reset to the original state. This mechanism could work as a sort of safety device; by requiring the 2nd ‘confirmation’ input, one can drastically reduce, or even eliminate, the frequency of false-inputs.

To accomplish this, we are constructing chimeric quorum sensing receptors that can localize on Lactobacillus membrane and detect autoinducing peptides (AIPs) released by S. aureus. The ligand binding to the chimeric receptor will trigger downstream plnABCD pathway and initiate the synthesis and secretion of RNAIII inhibiting peptide (RIP), a heptapeptide with proven effectiveness in attenuating S. aureus virulence. The possibility of achieving this lies in the structural homology of the catalytic domain of the quorum sensing receptors in Lactobacillus and S. aureus. Both receptors belong to the HPK10 subfamily of a two-component histidine kinase family.

In our project, we explored the possibility of harnessing a biological system as an alternative solution for data en/decryption and storage.  By using E. coli, we engineered and devised a prototype, dubbed E. cryptor, for 1) bio-encryption and -decryption with error checking; and 2) data storage in a bacterial system.  In the age of synthetic biology, designed microorganisms may carry a specific DNA barcode to be distinguished from their natural counterparts.

We plan to use the decreasing pH during curdling and the addition of nicin as the two inputs. To achieve the AND gate we will be using the CRE gene in combination with loxP sites.

Synthetic biology offers great opportunity for biosensors, however current designs require hours before useful output. To tackle this issue in the field, it's crucial that our project can respond in minutes, hence we have engineered a fast, modular sensor framework. This allows detection of a range of different parasites, and may also be used as an environmental tool for mapping their spread. We have developed two new technologies that enable our modular input/output - a novel cell surface biosensor, customisable for specific parasitic proteases, linked through quorum-sensing to a new 'fast-response' module capable of producing a detectable output in minutes. To demonstrate the concept, we've designed and fabricated B. subtilis to give a striking colour readout upon detecting the waterborne Schistosoma parasite which affects 200 million people worldwide"

Baker’s yeast was chosen because in some sense yeast have a system that responds to voltage input. With a voltage stimulus one can open the voltage-gated calcium channels of yeast, causing calcium ions to rush into the cytoplasm. This causes calcineurin to dephosphorylate Crz1, which enters the nucleus and binds various promoters.

Similarly, low oxygen zones can develop in solid tumors in numerous mammalian cancer models.

"Abstract":"The RMIT 2010 iGEM team has attempted to create a biological system that will produce peptides at a low economic cost. This biological machine includes the use of a T7 promoter regulated by the Lac elements to express a soluble thermostable protein carrier molecule with an attached peptide of interest. Taq polymerase will be attached to this peptide via a thermolabile bond allowing the peptide to be cleaved using just temperature. The polymerase has furthermore been mutated in such a way to avoid interactions with nucleic acids, thus diminishing the effects it may have in the bacterial host cell. This system can be adopted and enhanced to produce libraries or large scales of peptides/drugs without the high price tag attached to then be distributed to large communities that otherwise cannot afford the cost of research nor treatment."

"Abstract":"When generating flow through a microcapillary tube, engineers are met with problems in generating force and keeping fluids mixed or separated. Inspired by an article by Kim et al on bacterial carpets that could generate flow, we have designed a biological system in E. coli that can induce flow and increase mixing in a fluid, essentially working as a microscopic flow actuator. The actuator uses E. coli’s flagellas and can be switched on and off using light. Our system is composed of several novel parts: a photosensor, that controls the tumbling frequency of E. coli’s flagella via chemical pathways; a hyperflagellation part, to increase the number of flagella and the power of the system; a retinal producing part, that works with the 2009 Cambridge’s iGEM team’s β-Carotene brick, which we have helped further characterize.

Vibrio cholera was chosen as a test-case, giving us two potential routes to engineer E.coli to recognise the pathogen: 1. Fusion of cholera’s receptor (CqsS) for its quorum sensing molecule (CAI-1) with the internal apparatus of one of E.coli’s general stress detecting systems (BarA). 2. Engineer the whole cholera quorum sensing system into E.coli.Each of these would then be connected to a representation system (GFP or E.chromi) to visualize the pathogen"

"Abstract":"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic disease in which joint matrix is degraded and chondrocytes undergo disordered and hypertrophic differentiation, symptoms including joint pain, tenderness and stiffness. We proposed two synthetic-biological approaches to OA, one with a eukaryotic genetic circuit and another prokaryotic. Both circuits are composed of three systems: \"Detector\", \"Actuator\" and \"Supervisor\". As for Detector, we built tissue-specific promoters in the eukaryotic circuit, while inflammation factors are employed as signals of OA in the prokaryotic circuit. The same Actuator shared by two circuits generates proteins col2a1, which replenishes the degraded matrix, and oct4, which reverses the disordered differentiation. The eukaryotic Supervisor part has an original design in which a photo-sensitive cation channel crosstalks with certain cellular signaling pathways, resulting in the light-controlled expression of col2a1 and oct4; in the counterpart of prokaryotic circuit, both injected inducers and over-population lead the engineered bacteria to suicide, thus attenuating possible side effects"

E. coli engineered to express CqsA could grow along with regular gut flora and render V. cholerae avirulent by maintaining high CAI-1 concentrations. To lessen its metabolic burden, the system should respond to low concentrations of autoinducer produced by V. cholerae and co-ordinate this response using the Lux quorum-sensing system. We have explored rearranging the network architecture of the Lux system to give bistable expression. A model to describe bistability was formed using ODEs and implemented in C++.

However, many important biological processes are governed by the ratio between the concentrations of multiple chemicals. To create systems capable of responding to more complex input data, the Stanford team designed two types of ratio-measuring sensors. The first sensor utilizes two unique small RNAs to inhibit the transcription of two operons, each responding to an environmental factor and having a specific flourescent protein (or output gene). By manipulating the number of small RNAs produced, a tipping point between outputs can be established for different input ratios. The second sensor uses a phosphorylatable protein to control the transcription rate of an output promoter. By linearly associating two chemical inputs to the production of a kinase and a phosphatase, the ratio of the two environmental factors indirectly dictates the activity of the output promoter"

However, extracting the hydrocarbons requires large volumes of water which are then contaminated with naphthenic acids, heavy metals and residual hydrocarbons.  These ‘tailings’ are acutely toxic to higher organisms, though some bacteria and algae can survive in these environs.  Our knowledge of metabolic pathways capable of degrading such contaminants (bioremediation) is limited.  However, the known pathways tend to be slow and inefficient.  The breakdown of many polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons generates a common intermediate, catechol that is further degraded to Acetyl-CoA.  Metabolic channeling is an effect whereby intermediates are shuttled between enzymes in a pathway circumventing free diffusion into the cytosol.  Here, we present a design, modeling and baseline experiments aimed at demonstrating optimization of catechol degradation using the principle of metabolic channeling in an E. coli proof of concept system"

The work will be complemented with the implementation of the expression of  LEA (late embryogenesis abundant) “antifreeze” protein. Summarizing, we are going to build a engineered yeast resistant to temperature changes and able to produce a dark pigment which will be the responsible of a global temperature increase on Mars"

"Description":" Exploring AHL inducible fluorescence",
"Abstract":"AHL mediated quorum sensing is utilized by many gram negative bacteria for both intra and interspecies communication. Cells containing synthetic DNA constructs that produce fluorescent proteins in the presence of AHLs could be used as in situ reporters of the AHL milleu in dynamic natural systems like biofilms and plant root nodulation. Additionally, cells that can produce AHLs could be used to alter the signalling in these systems and examine the results. Finally, different combinations and spacial arrangements of AHL inducible reporters, AHL producing cells and AHL degrading cells all regulated by the AHL milleu of the media could allow for information processing through the interactions between such nodes. Out team designed a number of AHL regulated nodes, devices that each respond to AHL levels in different ways, and attempted to build some of these nodes to characterize their behavior"

"Description":" Quorum Sensing Amplifiers and a Codesign Approach for Information Processing",
"Abstract":"Synthetic biology endeavors to create information processing systems modeled on digital electronics.  The use of quorum sensing can help transform an inherently analog molecular signal into a binary response and simultaneously allow the tuning of input response thresholds and signal amplification.  This project demonstrates these capabilities through experimentation and modeling.  Another candidate for reapplying an electronic engineering technique is the codesign of hardware and software to implement a function.   In synthetic biology, codesign might mean implementing a design spec in different expression control regimes and comparing their relative merits.  Our work examines the codesign concept by constructing an AND gate in three different design domains.  We explore the application of these ideas with an environmental sensor.  A unique aspect of our project is the collaborative nature involving five institutions at three locations"

"Description":" Design and development of the GenoTHREAT gene sequence screening software",
"Abstract":"In order to mitigate the biosecurity risks associated with the potential dual use of gene synthesis, the U.S. Government published a draft version of a “Screening Framework Guidance for Synthetic Double-Stranded DNA Providers.” This document outlines a minimal DNA sequence screening protocol that gene synthesis companies are encouraged to use prior to fulfilling an order. The protocol relies on the “Best Match” method developed in response to the limitations of other screening protocols previously proposed by trade organizations. The objective of the “Best Match” method is to identify sequences which are uniquely related to Select Agents or Toxins. The GenoTHREAT software is being developed in accordance with the Government guidance and, to our knowledge, is the first implementation of the sequence screening procedure outlined in the guidance. Although software characterization has elucidated both strengths and limitations, GenoTHREAT appears to be a viable tool for sequence screening"

"Description":" An universal platform for protein delivery to the mammalian cells",
"Abstract":"Our project consists of two parts: BactoDHL and RBS Measurement. BactoDHL is a universal platform for protein and DNA delivery to the mammalian cells. It's based on E. coli strain expressing invasion determinants: invasin from Yersinia pestis and listeriolysin (LLO) from Listeria monocytogenes. Invasin causes uptake of the bacterium into the mammalian cell by induction of endocytosis. Bacterial cells are lysed in the endosome and then LLO is released. LLO is a pore-forming toxin which causes endosomal membrane disruption and release of the payload (either protein or DNA) into cytoplasm of the mammalian cell. In order to fine-tune expression of genes used in our project we conducted measurement of various RBS parts included in 2010 spring distribution both from Community and Anderson's collections. We used standard measurement kit composed of promoter BBa_J23100 and GFP+terminator part BBa_I130401. We performed both relative and absolute RBS strength measurement"

"Description":" Antibiotics for the 21st Century",
"Abstract":"While vital to our quality of life, traditional antibiotics face the serious problems of widespread bacterial resistance and destruction of natural gut flora - problems which call for improved twenty-first century antibiotics.  Using synthetic biology tools, we designed, built, and tested two new systems to fight infections by both broad types of bacteria - Gram-positive and Gram-negative.  Our first project targets Bacillus anthracis, the Gram-positive pathogen that causes anthrax.  We re-engineered an enzyme to remove the pathogen's protective coating, rendering it defenseless against the immune system.  In our second project, we re-engineered and transplanted a protein secretion system capable of combating Gram-negative bacteria into E. coli.  This system was designed to target Gram-negative pathogens in a modular and controllable fashion.  These two systems are the vanguard of a new era of antibiotics using the power of nature harnessed with the tools of synthetic biology"

"Abstract":"Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a model unicellular eukaryotic chassis; however when compared with Escherichia coli the available synthetic biology tools are lacking. To remedy this problem the 2010 Washington University iGEM team has introduced a synthetic alternative splicing tool, as well as designed and produced new BioBricks parts to ease transformation of synthetic constructs into S. cerevisiae. A mutually exclusive exon splicing system was formulated in which Sex-lethal interacts with the native splicing machinery to affect splice site choice. Two vectors have been designed to facilitate simple bacterial BioBrick manipulation and subsequent chromosomal integration into the yeast genome. A yeast positive selection marker BioBrick has been produced for the first time. Chromosomal integration with positive selection will stabilize and streamline BioBrick transformations into S. cerevisiae. A synthetic splicing assembly will allow for new synthetic biology techniques such as isoform engineering of proteins or combinatorial logic"

"Description":" Staphiscope: diagnosis of S. aureus through bacterial wiretapping",
"Abstract":"Superbugs, or antibiotic resistant microorganisms, are microbes that have become resistant to traditional treatments. These types of infections are difficult to diagnose, treat, and eradicate, making the healing process time consuming and resource intensive. The native quorum-sensing unit from S.aureus (the Agr system), will be introduced into a non-pathogenic strain of E.coli. The E.coli will then effectively have the ability to eavesdrop on the activity of the pathogenic organism and emit an indication of the magnitude of the infection in the form of RFP. Using sensitivity tuners the system can be designed such that the response will occur at an exact level, when the size of the population poses a threat to the host. Upon a positive result from a diagnosis, further tests could be done to specify whether MRSA (methicillin-resistant S. aureus) or MSSA (Methicillin-sensitive S. aureus) are present"

The Super Cell website already gives us a glimpse of the products that will be available in local stores in the near future. By putting already existing and far-out in the future applications next to each other in a familiar environment such as a webshop, the project aims to improve public awareness about Synthetic Biology and at the same time foster a debate on how we want to see it manifested in our everyday lives. This kind of discussion, we feel, is urgent to have if we as a society want to influence how this powerful science will affect our future lives"

"Description":" Universal Platform for Polypeptide Delivery: Intelligent Delivery of Ingestible Enzyme Treatment (iDIET)",
"Abstract":"We have designed a universal platform for polypeptide release within the small intestine of the human gut. Our model system release beta-galactosidase, a functional homologue of human lactase, once it reaches the duodenum to help a lactose intolerant patient metabolize lactose. The chassis for this system is the common probiotic in yoghurt, Lactobacillus acidophilus. Once the Lactobacillus acidophilus has reached the duodenum, they will lyse by either by a timed inducible/repressible system, a bile-inducible system, or an encryption system. Using DNA we can mimic the functionality of a combination lock, and produce a \"locked\" gene, which can be effectively \"unlocked\" only after a specific sequence of inputs. Since DNA functions as a logical medium, the \"locked\" and \"unlocked\" states are heritable, which makes this system useful as the computational basis for many higher-order genetic devices from bacterial calculators to engineering of new metabolic pathways to bacterial drug delivery systems."

"Abstract":"Whole-cell bacterial biosensors have been developed for a range of applications. In this project, the concept of a whole-cell biosensor has been adapted for medical use as a diagnostic for viral infection through engineering a commensal bacterium. Lactobacilli are the predominant commensal organisms in the human vaginal mucosa and are ideally placed to detect the presence of a sexually transmitted infection, such as Human Papillomavirus. A strain of this bacterium has been modified to produce a chromogenic reporter, which is visible to the naked eye, when ‘switched on’ through exposure to the input signal (viral infection). However, in order for this to be clearly visible in vivo, this signal needs to be transmitted throughout the entire bacterial population. Thus, this project focused on a) modifying a Gram-positive bacterium to produce the chromogenic reporter; b) using a heterologous quorum-sensing mechanism to propagate an auto-regulated feedback loop amongst a bacterial population"

"Abstract":"What does it take to make bacteria produce an electrical circuit? One of the most exciting uses for synthetic biology is in the design of biological systems that can replace and improve industrial processes. By achieving industrial goals using biological processes, we predict dramatic reductions in economic and environmental manufacturing costs. Our project is a first step towards biologically synthesized electronic circuits. Based on precedence of naturally redox-capable bacteria, we generated a system in E. coli that reduces metal in solution. Depending on the application, this system has the ability to form a conductive copper sulfide that can be localized with high precision. In the future our bacteria could catalyze metal deposition to form electrical circuits of any desired dimension and complexity"

"Description":" Bach: gene composer",
"Abstract":"While former iGEM software teams were mainly focusing on the assembly of biobricks into a predictable system, our software Bach targets at the coding sequence of biobrick itself. We first built a mathematical model to quantitatively predict RIPS (ribosome initiation per sec) of any given coding sequence in any organism. We then constructed three modules (synonymous substitution, optimization and RIPS design) to process input coding sequences. Bach could recompose the input sequence into an output one that better suits the host organism and performs the specific translational rate of desire. In this way, the discordant tunes of codon bias in biobricks from different genetic backgrounds could be synchronized, and the realization of a more predictable and robust system would be possible. Our work not only benefits current works involving exogenous protein expression, but also makes a big step towards standardization and characterization of biobricks"
